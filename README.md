# Quality Assurance Test Scripts Repository

Welcome to my Quality Assurance Test Scripts Repository, where I showcase a selection of test code and scripts that I've created to validate the quality and functionality of software applications. These scripts represent a significant part of my work as a Support Engineer II and highlight my proficiency in software testing and quality assurance.

## About This Repository

In this repository, you'll find a range of test scripts designed for various applications, covering aspects such as functionality, performance, and user experience. These scripts have been instrumental in ensuring the reliability and quality of our software products.

## Directory Structure

- `tests/businessLogicTest/functionalTesting/`: Test scripts written in NodeJS related to API testing.
- `tests/businessLogicTest/src/API/`: Code written in JavaScript calling the needed API calls. This was needed as there needed to be 
an authorization token to call the service. The Post and Get function made it possible to test these scenarios needed.

## How to Use

Each directory contains scripts and instructions for their usage. Feel free to explore and adapt these scripts to your own QA processes. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for visiting this repository, and I hope you find these test scripts valuable for your QA endeavors.
